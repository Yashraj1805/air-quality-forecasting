# GitHub and Railway Deployment Instructions

## 1. Connect your local repository to GitHub

After creating your repository on GitHub (https://github.com/new), run these commands:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace:
- YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
- YOUR_REPO_NAME with your repository name (e.g., air-quality-forecasting)

## 2. Deploy from GitHub to Railway

After pushing your code to GitHub:

1. Go to https://railway.app/ and sign in
2. Click "New Project" 
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will automatically detect your Procfile and deploy your app
6. After deployment, you can find your API URL in the project settings

## 3. Testing your API

Once deployed, test your API with:

```
curl -X GET https://your-railway-app-url.railway.app/get
```

For predictions:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"PM2.5": 35.0, "PM10": 70.0, "NO2": 80.0, "CO": 1.2, "SO2": 40.0, "O3": 50.0}' https://your-railway-app-url.railway.app/predict
```
